Context Caching
The DeepSeek API Context Caching on Disk Technology is enabled by default for all users, allowing them to benefit without needing to modify their code.

Each user request will trigger the construction of a hard disk cache. If subsequent requests have overlapping prefixes with previous requests, the overlapping part will only be fetched from the cache, which counts as a "cache hit."

Note: Between two requests, only the repeated prefix part can trigger a "cache hit." Please refer to the example below for more details.

Example 1: Long Text Q&A
First Request

messages: [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an experienced financial report analyst..."}
    {"role": "user", "content": "<financial report content>\n\nPlease summarize the key information of this financial report."}
]


Second Request

messages: [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an experienced financial report analyst..."}
    {"role": "user", "content": "<financial report content>\n\nPlease analyze the profitability of this financial report."}
]


In the above example, both requests have the same prefix, which is the system message + <financial report content> in the user message. During the second request, this prefix part will count as a "cache hit."

Example 2: Multi-round Conversation
First Request

messages: [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}
]

Second Request

messages: [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of China is Beijing."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of the United States?"}
]

In this example, the second request can reuse the initial system message and user message from the first request, which will count as a "cache hit."

Example 3: Using Few-shot Learning
In practical applications, users can enhance the model's output performance through few-shot learning. Few-shot learning involves providing a few examples in the request to allow the model to learn a specific pattern. Since few-shot generally provides the same context prefix, the cost of few-shot is significantly reduced with the support of context caching.

First Request

messages: [    
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a history expert. The user will provide a series of questions, and your answers should be concise and start with `Answer:`"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "In what year did Qin Shi Huang unify the six states?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 221 BC"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the founder of the Han Dynasty?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Liu Bang"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the last emperor of the Tang Dynasty?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Li Zhu"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Zhu Yuanzhang"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the founding emperor of the Qing Dynasty?"}
]


Second Request

messages: [    
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a history expert. The user will provide a series of questions, and your answers should be concise and start with `Answer:`"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "In what year did Qin Shi Huang unify the six states?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: 221 BC"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the founder of the Han Dynasty?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Liu Bang"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the last emperor of the Tang Dynasty?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Li Zhu"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who was the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Zhu Yuanzhang"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "When did the Shang Dynasty fall?"},        
]


In this example, 4-shots are used. The only difference between the two requests is the last question. The second request can reuse the content of the first 4 rounds of dialogue from the first request, which will count as a "cache hit."

Checking Cache Hit Status
In the response from the DeepSeek API, we have added two fields in the usage section to reflect the cache hit status of the request:

prompt_cache_hit_tokens: The number of tokens in the input of this request that resulted in a cache hit (0.1 yuan per million tokens).

prompt_cache_miss_tokens: The number of tokens in the input of this request that did not result in a cache hit (1 yuan per million tokens).

Hard Disk Cache and Output Randomness
The hard disk cache only matches the prefix part of the user's input. The output is still generated through computation and inference, and it is influenced by parameters such as temperature, introducing randomness.

Additional Notes
The cache system uses 64 tokens as a storage unit; content less than 64 tokens will not be cached.

The cache system works on a "best-effort" basis and does not guarantee a 100% cache hit rate.

Cache construction takes seconds. Once the cache is no longer in use, it will be automatically cleared, usually within a few hours to a few days.
